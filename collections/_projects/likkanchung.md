[likkanchung.com](https://likkanchung.com) is my personal website, the one you are on now!

The website originally started in August 2016, as a place to host my future portfolio, CV and anything else I thing should be here. It started as a way for me to learn HTML and CSS, as I created the first iteration of this site in 4 days. Over the last few years, it has gone through several iterations and now incorporates a blog for _irregular_ updates.

The current iteration of this page is a static Jekyll website, hosted on GitHub pages. After working on the [CSSBham](https://likkanchung.com/projects/cssbham) website, I found that Jekyll was a much better way than having hard-coded HTML/PHP content in webpages.

Most of this webpage is styled using the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) framework, which just makes styling easier, faster, and generally nicer than having to make all of elements myself. I have found that the cards and carousel features have been particularly useful - especially on my [CV](https://likkanchung.com/cv) page.

Moving onto GitHub pages, from pivate hosting, has been quite useful in several ways. Firstly, the its fundamental integration with the repository means I can make changes easily through the CI build in GitHub Pages. I couldn't do this easily with my web hosting provider. Secondly, it makes my code more centralised - it's in one place and not two. Finally, there's more GitHub tools I can use.
