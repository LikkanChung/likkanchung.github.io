As part of a group project we created this game. Scrimmage is a multiplayer, free for all death match. 

## What is Scrimmage

Players gain score by being the last player remaining in the map. Once this has happened, the map is changed and all players are spawned in again, and the players again fight to the death. The game is terminated by a timer. When the timer runs out, the players are shown on a podium, in the order of their scores.

This is the content of the website we created to demonstrate this project. The original is [here](https://togetherinthelight.wordpress.com/).

## Why was it made

The project was created as part of a Team Project module at University. In a team of 6, we had 11 weeks to create a video game which included five core features implementing Competitive play, Networking, Aritifical Intelligence, Audio, and User Interface. The project was made in Java, with graphics being supported by the JavaFX library. We were also able to use JUnit, Log4j and Maven to stay productive during development. 

Teamwork was the core learining objective of this module and we successfully created this peoduct with that in mind. We utilised tools such as Slack for communication and Trello for tracking the workflow. Twice weekly meetings allowed us to stay focused and set new targets as we progresserd through the tasks we assigned to ourselves. 

The project mostly followed a full development lifecycle, starting from idea generation, to outlining the system requirement specifications. The final submission of the project required a demonstration, a full report, test plans and UML diagrams.
